EAT is a Python toolkit for constructing advanced, multi-agent applications where autonomy, adaptability, and robust orchestration are crucial. It enables the implementation of **AI-First strategies**, where agent-driven workflows are designed to handle tasks that complex human workflows are currently capable of doing. Move beyond simple agent chains to create ecosystems that can dynamically respond to requirements, learn from interactions, and improve over time‚Äîall within defined governance boundaries and now powered by a unified **MongoDB backend**.

**üéâ MongoDB Migration Update! üéâ**

The Evolving Agents Toolkit has successfully completed its initial migration to **MongoDB** as its unified backend! This replaces previous file-based storage and ChromaDB, bringing enhanced scalability and robustness.

*   The core framework (`SmartLibrary`, `SmartAgentBus`, `LLMCache`, `IntentPlan` persistence) now fully utilizes MongoDB.
*   All examples in the `examples/` directory, including the comprehensive demo **`examples/invoice_processing/architect_zero_comprehensive_demo.py`**, have been updated and are working with the new MongoDB backend.

The migration of all examples to MongoDB is now complete. We are now focusing on updating the test suite.

## Why Evolving Agents Toolkit for AI-First?

Building true **AI-First systems**‚Äîwhere agent workflows are capable of handling tasks currently performed in complex human processes‚Äîrequires more than just individual agents. EAT focuses on orchestrating the entire **agent ecosystem**:

*   **üéØ Goal-Oriented Orchestration:** Interact via high-level goals given to a central `SystemAgent`. The `SystemAgent` handles the complex "how," mimicking a project manager. It plans, finds or creates components, executes tasks, and manages internal workflows.
*   **üß† Intelligent Component Management & Discovery:** A `SmartLibrary` (now backed by **MongoDB**) acts as a central repository for reusable agents and tools, enabling semantic search (using MongoDB Atlas Vector Search or equivalent) and versioning. It supports **task-aware retrieval** using a dual embedding strategy.
*   **üöå Dynamic Communication & Service Bus:** The `SmartAgentBus` (registry and logs now in **MongoDB**) allows agents to discover and request capabilities dynamically, decoupling components.
*   **üå± Adaptive Evolution:** Components aren't static. EAT provides mechanisms (`EvolveComponentTool`) for the `SystemAgent` to adapt agents and tools.
*   **üõ°Ô∏è Governed Execution & Human-in-the-Loop:** Implement optional, multi-level review checkpoints using the `IntentReviewAgent`. `IntentPlan`s are now persisted in **MongoDB**.
*   **üß© Modular & Interoperable:** Seamlessly integrate agents and tools built with different frameworks (e.g., BeeAI, OpenAI Assistants SDK).
*   **üí° Task-Specific Context & Unified Backend:** The architecture incorporates `SmartContext` and a **Dual Embedding Strategy** within the `SmartLibrary`. All core data persistence, including component metadata, embeddings, agent registry, logs, and LLM cache, is now unified in **MongoDB**, simplifying the stack and enhancing scalability.
*   **ü§ñ Self-Management & Improvement:** System agents like `SystemAgent` and `ArchitectZero` can collaboratively design, implement, manage, and improve the ecosystem.

**In short: EAT provides the essential structure and tools to build AI-First systems that coordinate diverse capabilities, adapt to new challenges, provide relevant context, manage complexity autonomously, and operate under governance‚Äîall on a robust and scalable MongoDB backend.**

## Key Features

*   **`SystemAgent` Orchestrator:** Central ReAct agent managing component lifecycles and task execution.
*   **`SmartLibrary` with Dual Embedding (MongoDB Backend):** Persistent storage for components in MongoDB. Features advanced semantic search using **MongoDB Atlas Vector Search** (or equivalent) for its Dual Embedding Strategy:
    *   **Content Embedding (`content_embedding`):** Represents `T_orig` (component code/content).
    *   **Applicability Embedding (`applicability_embedding`):** Represents `T_raz` (LLM-generated applicability description).
    *   **Task-Aware Search:** Finds components based on what they *are* and *what they are relevant for*.
*   **`SmartAgentBus` (Dual Bus, MongoDB Backend):** Manages agent registration, discovery, and communication. Registry and execution logs are stored in MongoDB.
*   **`SmartContext`:** Facilitates passing task-relevant data.
*   **Internal Workflow Engine:** `SystemAgent` internally uses `GenerateWorkflowTool` and `ProcessWorkflowTool` for complex tasks.
*   **Intent Review System (MongoDB Backend):** Optional human-in-the-loop review. `IntentPlan` objects are generated by `ProcessWorkflowTool` and persisted in MongoDB for review via `ApprovePlanTool`.
*   **`LLMCache` (MongoDB Backend):** LLM completions and embeddings are cached in MongoDB with TTL for efficiency.
*   **Unified Data Persistence:** All primary data stores (SmartLibrary, AgentBus registry/logs, LLMCache, IntentPlans) now reside in MongoDB, eliminating JSON file stores and ChromaDB.
*   ... (Component Evolution, Multi-Framework Support, Governance & Safety, ArchitectZero features remain conceptually similar but now operate on MongoDB data)

## MongoDB Setup

**EAT now uses MongoDB as its unified backend.** Using MongoDB Atlas with Vector Search is highly recommended.

1.  **Set up MongoDB:**
    *   Follow the detailed instructions in [**docs/MONGO-SETUP.md**](./docs/MONGO-SETUP.md) to set up MongoDB Atlas (recommended) or a self-hosted instance.
    *   This includes creating a database, user, and configuring network access.
2.  **Configure Vector Search Indexes (CRITICAL for SmartLibrary & SmartAgentBus):**
    *   As described in `docs/MONGO-SETUP.md`, you **must** create Vector Search Indexes in MongoDB Atlas for:
        *   `eat_components` collection: Two indexes, one on `content_embedding` and one on `applicability_embedding`. (Names in Atlas: `idx_components_content_embedding` and `applicability_embedding` respectively, or as defined in `SmartLibrary.py`).
        *   `eat_agent_registry` collection: One index on `description_embedding`. (Name in Atlas: `vector_index_agent_description`, or as defined in `SmartAgentBus.py`).
    *   Ensure the `numDimensions` in your index definitions match your embedding model's output (e.g., 1536 for `text-embedding-3-small`).
3.  **Environment Variables:**
    *   Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
    *   Edit `.env` and add your `MONGODB_URI` and `MONGODB_DATABASE_NAME`.
        ```env
        MONGODB_URI="your_mongodb_srv_connection_string"
        MONGODB_DATABASE_NAME="evolving_agents_db"
        ```

## Quick Start

**1. Setup Environment (after MongoDB setup):**

```bash
# Ensure .env is configured with your OpenAI API Key and MongoDB URI
# nano .env OR use your preferred editor

# Optionally enable Intent Review:
# INTENT_REVIEW_ENABLED=true
# INTENT_REVIEW_LEVELS=design,components,intents
```
*Configure other settings like `LLM_MODEL`, `LLM_EMBEDDING_MODEL` if needed.*

**2. Run the Comprehensive Demo:**

The `architect_zero_comprehensive_demo.py` script showcases the `SystemAgent` orchestrating a complex task (invoice processing) using the MongoDB backend. It demonstrates component discovery, potential creation/evolution, and execution. If `INTENT_REVIEW_ENABLED=true` and the `intents` level is active, it will pause for human review with intent plans stored in MongoDB.

```bash
python examples/invoice_processing/architect_zero_comprehensive_demo.py
```

**3. Explore Output:**

After the demo runs:

*   `final_processing_output.json`: Contains the final structured JSON result from the `SystemAgent`. (This remains file-based as it's a direct output of the demo).
*   **MongoDB Collections:**
    *   `eat_components`: Stores `SmartLibrary` records (agents, tools, firmware) including their embeddings.
    *   `eat_agent_registry`: Stores `SmartAgentBus` agent registrations.
    *   `eat_agent_bus_logs`: Stores logs of agent interactions via the bus.
    *   `eat_llm_cache`: Stores cached LLM responses and embeddings (if cache enabled).
    *   `eat_intent_plans` (if review enabled for 'intents' level): Stores `IntentPlan` objects.
    *   You can inspect these collections using MongoDB Compass, `mongosh`, or your MongoDB Atlas Data Explorer.
*   `intent_plan_demo.json` (If review enabled for 'intents' level and `output_path` in `ApprovePlanTool` is set): An optional file copy of the generated intent plan that was reviewed.

*(**Note:** All examples in the `examples/` directory have been updated to use the MongoDB backend. The test suite is currently being updated.)*
