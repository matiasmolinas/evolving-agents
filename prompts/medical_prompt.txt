Create a cardiovascular health assessment system that analyzes patient physiological data to evaluate cardiovascular disease risk. 
The system should:

1. Extract physiological data from patient records (vital signs, lab values, anthropometrics, risk factors)
2. Calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) and classify weight status
3. Apply the Framingham Risk Score formula to determine 10-year cardiovascular disease risk
4. Analyze the combined data to provide clinical interpretations, concerning findings, and evidence-based recommendations
5. Generate a comprehensive patient assessment with appropriate medical disclaimers

The system should use established medical formulas and guidelines for all calculations and risk assessments.
Leverage existing components from the library when possible and create new components for missing functionality.

Please generate a complete workflow for this cardiovascular assessment system.
