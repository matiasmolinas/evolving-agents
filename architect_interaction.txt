TASK REQUIREMENT:

    Create a comprehensive medical diagnostic system that analyzes patient medical records to provide clinical insights. The system should:
    
    1. Extract and structure patient information, vital signs, medications, and symptoms from medical records
    2. Analyze symptoms to identify possible medical conditions and their likelihood
    3. Check for potential interactions between current medications and suggest adjustments if needed
    4. Generate treatment recommendations based on the identified conditions and patient history
    5. Provide appropriate medical disclaimers and highlight when further specialist consultation is needed
    
    The system should leverage existing medical components from the library when possible,
    evolve them where improvements are needed, and create new components for missing functionality.
    
    The system must handle sensitive medical information appropriately and ensure all recommendations
    include proper medical disclaimers. It should also identify when symptoms may indicate serious conditions
    requiring immediate medical attention.
    
    Please generate a complete workflow for this medical diagnostic system.
    

AGENT THOUGHT PROCESS:
Here is the complete YAML workflow for the medical diagnostic system:
